                    Rien n’est jamais fini, il suffit d’un peu de bonheur pour que tout recommence. -Émile Zola 
                    (lit. Nothing is ever finished; all it takes is a little happiness for everything to begin again.)
                    <br><br> &emsp;&emsp; There's something within the light. It's like that time when I was a child, submerged at the bottom of the pool, looking up, seeing the light refracting through the water. As I float closer, a green meadow comes forth and a steam-powered engine passes through. There, velvet red carpets, orange lights, and dark wooden walls cover the slightly cramped room. The overpowering smell of rich apple pie infuses the car. I can feel the leather seats but it doesn't feel right. My hands are black pegs of fur. Were they always like this? 
                    <br> &emsp;&emsp; “It seems you were successful.”
                    <br> &emsp;&emsp; I jump out of the hands that carry me. Glancing back, an older woman, putting down her newspaper, looks at me with a face that is simultaneously excited and concerned.
                    <br> &emsp;&emsp; “It was like that for my first time too.”
                    <br> &emsp;&emsp; Her first time? What did she mean? What is going on? 
                    <br> &emsp;&emsp; “Nya- nya- n-,” I can’t talk!?
                    <br> &emsp;&emsp; “Don’t worry.”
                    <br> &emsp;&emsp; Don’t worry? I have no idea what’s going on! 
                    <br> &emsp;&emsp; “Focus your mind,” she sighs calmly. “If you take a few breaths . . . you’ll remember everything soon enough.”
                    <br> &emsp;&emsp; <i>Fuuu</i>—Immediately, memories start flowing back to me: I am a beastman. Yes, I am a cat beastman. But this is the first time I have taken on this form. This must be that power that only, few even of this kind, possess: shapeshifting. 
                    <br> &emsp;&emsp; A subtle smile appears on my face, but I doubt anyone can tell. After all, I am now in my cat form.
                    <br> &emsp;&emsp; “Looks like you have finally begun to understand.”
                    <br> &emsp;&emsp; Well, never mind.
                    <br> &emsp;&emsp; I glance back at my mother’s head. I hadn’t even realized, but there were a pair of cat ears poking out of her luscious black hair. The same ones that were attached to me, apparently. I wonder why that makes us so much different from those Eldians. Why we always had to hide our identities back in Caphalon. We practically possess the same bodies, minds, and powers. In fact, we’re faster, and stronger. 
                    <br> &emsp;&emsp; Whenever I’ve asked this question, they always reply that it was a result of the War of Extermination. That we are paying for the price of our great great great ancestors. Because they tried to destroy human-kind. Because they succeeded and only left those select few. And because they had a hero. 
                    <br> &emsp;&emsp; Continuing to ponder, I attempt to get a peek through the window, jumping to the seat and then onto the window. It took my eyes a moment to adjust but once they did, I was greeted by the lush green grass and the pink and white poppies waving with the slight breeze, the clear water flowing along with the red- and orange-colored fish swimming along, and the light blue skies and fluffy, white clouds. 
                    <br> &emsp;&emsp; “It’s beautiful isn’t it? The view of spring.”
                    <br> &emsp;&emsp; “Mhmm—”
                    <br> &emsp;&emsp; At least we no longer have to worry about the war. As long as we hide our identity we will be fine. At least that's what everyone has been saying.
                    <br> &emsp;&emsp; “Well, it’s soon our stop, shall we prepare to get off,” she utters, as she looks down at her hand-clock. 
                    <br> &emsp;&emsp; She takes the last bite of her cream puff and licks the corner of her mouth. It looked tasty. Ahh if only I could have some. 
                    <br> &emsp;&emsp; For some reason, she kept looking back at me, getting a bit annoyed.
                    <br> &emsp;&emsp; “When do you plan on turning back? You can’t go walking out like <i>this</i>. At least not yet.”
                    <br> &emsp;&emsp; Oh right. Of course I need to turn back. “Wait, how do I do that?”
                    <br> &emsp;&emsp; With a deep sigh, she opens her arms for me to instinctively jump to. As she pats me, I start to lose consciousness and . . .
                    <br> &emsp;&emsp; As a reawoke, the ringing of a bell could be heard, followed by the sound of the woman: 
                    <br> &emsp;&emsp; “Hey, get up! We’re getting off now!”
                    <br> &emsp;&emsp; Ah—yes, I quickly put on my jacket, sliding my arms through the left, and then the right sleeve, looking around the room to check if I have left anything. Not that I really had anything besides my suitcase. The door to the train’s hallway slid open and I headed out after my mother, making sure to cover my head.
                    <br> &emsp;&emsp; “We won’t need to hide our identity soon,” she reminds with a motherly look on her face. “Not in Porthaven.”
                    <br> &emsp;&emsp; As we stepped out of the train, the slight breeze blew across my face, carrying with it the sweet smell of cherry blossoms.
